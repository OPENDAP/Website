## What is this?

This is an public empty repository for creating/closing issues, regarding the status of the draft website. The [Website Project](https://github.com/orgs/OPENDAP/projects/2) lives on a private Project Managing tool that one needs to get proper access. Currently, only the OPeNDAP Website Team has access to it.



## Quickstart

There are two places where to create an issue: a) Website Project, and b) Website Repo. It is recommended to create the issue directly on the [Website Repo](https://github.com/OPENDAP/Website). Below are the recommended instructions:


1. Under [Website/issues](https://github.com/OPENDAP/Website/issues), select `New Issue` (green icon).
2. Per request, consider the following template.

```
### Description
<!-- Brief 1 - 2 sentence description of the problem. -->

### Visual Aid
<!-- Screenshot clearly showing the relevant issue, or identifies the location where the issue can be found/reproduced. -->

### Page URL 
<!-- url where the issue was found. Do not display the entire Page URL (url is only for OPeNDAP team, and this repo is Public). Simply do: `HOMEPAGE/about/` instead of, for example, `https://www.opendap.org/about`. -->
```

3. On the right column tabs, select `Website` as the Project. That allows the issue to appear on the Website Project. This can happen before or after creating the issue on the `Website` Repo.

4. Once the issue is created, assign its status. On the right column under Projects, `Website` should be displaying, but `Status` may show as `None` or `unassigned`. Select instead `Backlog` from the status options.


If needed, you can inspect other issues, especially regarding steps 3-4.
