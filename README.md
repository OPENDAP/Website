# Website

This is an public empty repository for managing the Website project under OPeNDAP/Projects. The Project is private and to get access you will need to be granted access. The Website project can be accessed directly from this repository, and can be found under `Projects`. Yuu can access the Project following this link: [OPeNDAP/Project/Website](https://github.com/orgs/OPENDAP/projects/2)

# Quickstart

When opening an issue, make sure it has the following format:

    * Brief 1 - 2 sentence description of the problem.

    * Screenshot of the appropriate area.

    * Page URL where the issue was found. See **NOTE** below

Make sure to assign the issue to `Backlog` if it is new, and to assign the appropriate website Team member (either one of OPeNDAP team, or PL team).

### **NOTE**
Because the website is still on draft mode, and it is simply a staging url, there is no need to display the entire Page URL. Simply do: `HOMEPAGE/about/` instead of for example `https://www.opendap.org/about`.
