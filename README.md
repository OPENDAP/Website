# Website

This is an public empty repository for managing the Website project under OPeNDAP/Projects. The Project is private and to get access you will need to be granted access. The Website project can be accessed directly from this repository, and can be found under `Projects`. Yuu can access the Project following this link: [OPeNDAP/Project/Website](https://github.com/orgs/OPENDAP/projects/2)

# Quickstart

There are two ways to create issue: a) on the Website Project, and b) on the Website Repo. It is recommended to create the issue directly on the [Website Repo](https://github.com/OPENDAP/Website). Below are the recommended instructions:


1. Under [Website/issues](https://github.com/OPENDAP/Website/issues), select New Issue (green icon).
2. Per request, consider the following template (you can copy-paste the text - simply remove tabs).

```
### Description
Brief 1 - 2 sentence description of the problem.

### Visual Aid
Screenshot of the appropriate area.

### Page URL 
where the issue was found. See **NOTE** below
```

3. On the right column tabs, select `Website` as the Project. That allows the issue to appear on the Website Project. This can happen before or after creating the issue on the `Website` Repo.

4. Once the issue is created, assign its status. Similar to 3), on the right column under Project should be now  `Website`, but `Status` may show as `None`. Select instead `Backlog` from the status options.




### **NOTE**
Because the website is still on draft mode, and it is simply a staging url, there is no need to display the entire Page URL. Simply do: `HOMEPAGE/about/` instead of for example `https://www.opendap.org/about`.
